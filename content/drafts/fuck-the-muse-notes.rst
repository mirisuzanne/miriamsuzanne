Tools of Creative Summoning
===========================

We're still `working our way`_ through
the `curiosity shopping lists`_
we created a while back.
This is still step 2 in the
`overall creative process`_,
but it's a large step.
This is where we
*find or create all the material*.

We're trying to gather enough material
to organize (step 3) into a rough draft (step 4).

Blind Variation and Selective Retention
=======================================

|campbell|

In the 1960's,
psychologist `Donald Campbell`_ proposed
a theory of creative thought based on a process he called
*blind variation and selective retention*.

*Blind variation*
means generating ideas
without worrying about the utility of each one.
At some point you have to generate ideas
simply to see what the options are.

You've heard that idea before,
often called brainstorming.
But simply brainstorming `doesn't work`_.
There are wrong answers.
In fact, *most answers are wrong*,
and it's your job to determine which ones and why.
It's not good enough to blindly generate ideas,
we have to critique those ideas,
debate them,
and push deeper.

Your ability to criticize your own ideas as they come
helps you generate more (and better) ideas.
That's *selective retention*.
Keep the best, trash the rest,
rinse, and repeat.

Expand, contract, expand again.

This isn't *editing* yet,
because you don't yet have a draft worth revising.
You're honing the idea,
in order to generate more and better content.

Expanding
---------

  Take a tune, sing high when they sing low,
  sing fast when they sing slow,
  and you’ve got a new tune.

  *— Woody Guthrie*

Conceptual artists are masters of blind variation,
and everyone can learn from their process.
The tools available are endless,
but always boil down to a simple setup:
a set of ingredients,
and a set rules for manipulating them.

Mary Overlie developed a terminology of `viewpoints`_
for looking at dance as a collection of its parts,
similar to the `elements of design`_
used by many visual artists.
She started with
Space, Story, Time, Emotion, Movement, and Shape.
Anne Bogart and Tina Landau expanded on the list,
translating it for the theatre:

- Time: Tempo, Duration, Kinesthetic Response, and Repetition.
- Space: Shape, Gesture, Architecture, Spatial Relationship, and Topography.
- Vocal: Pitch, Dynamic, and Timbre.

These overlapp with the elements and principles of design
(different people use slightly different lists):

- Elements: Line, Shape, Direction, Size, Texture, Color, and Value.
- Principles: Balance, Gradation, Repetition, Contrast, Harmony, Dominance, and Unity.

Writing elements might include
Tone, Vocabulary, Perspective, Sentence Structure, and Imagery,
as well as Repetition, Duration, and many others that overlap
with theatre and design.

It's not important that these lists be perfect or complete,
what matters is that we can use them to generate ideas.
Explore each viewpoint to see what happens —
faster, slower, longer, shorter, etc.
The experiment doesn't need to succeed
in order to be useful.
Take what works and leave the rest behind.

Contracting

From Suck to Non-Suck
---------------------

I pay my rent by designing web applications for clients.
I've been doing that since 2006,
and it can be a stressful job.
On a bad day,
I think my job is to argue with clients —
defending my well-researched decisions against uninformed opinion.
On those days I want to quit and work in a factory.

On those days I'm wrong.
My job is not to convince client that the design works already:
my job is to make it work *better*.
The best work doesn't happen in a vacuum —
`it requires a critique and change`_.

.. _it requires a critique and change: http://99u.com/articles/7224/why-fighting-for-our-ideas-makes-them-better

To avoid this problem at OddBird,
we've adapted a a process that is often credited to `Pixar`_ —
meeting regularly to critique our own work —
with clients in the room.
No complaint is too small,
and everything gets debate.
The goal, as `Pixar's President explains it`_,
is "going from suck to non-suck".

.. _Pixar's President explains it: http://www.fastcompany.com/1742431/pixars-motto-going-suck-nonsuck

You have to start somewhere,
and wherever you start is bound to suck.
Your job as an artist
is to hate the work enough that you can fix it.

Failure isn't Failure
---------------------

`This American Life`_ host Ira Glass
has some advice for young artists,
but helpful for everyone:

.. _This American Life: http://www.pri.org/this-american-life.html

|ira glass|

He's talking about the growth of every artist,
but the same is true for the growth of every project.

It doesn't matter how good your work is right now.
If it's not done, keep fighting with it.
The point of `high standards`_ isn't that you always meet them,
it's that you keep pushing.

.. _high standards: http://www.psmag.com/culture-society/the-two-faces-of-perfectionism-8137/

Every success will come from a string of failures,
and that's just fine.

Remember, you are not the work.
Your cretions, as much as they mean to you,
are not you.
When the work sucks,
that doesn't mean you suck,
it means you still have some work to do.
Stand back and consider the piece from a distance —
what's working and what isn't.
Then go watch a movie,
read a book,
take a bath,
get laid,
eat some ice cream,
or whatever you do to take care of yourself.
